# Precision Agriculture System

This project is a data-driven Precision Agriculture system designed to support sustainable farming practices in Nigeria. It leverages IoT sensors, remote sensing, and AI models to monitor soil health, optimize water usage, and predict crop yield — empowering farmers with real-time, actionable insights.

## 🌱 Problem Statement

Many farmers face challenges like poor land management, water scarcity, soil degradation, and low crop yields due to lack of data-driven decision tools. This project aims to solve that by building an intelligent system that ensures resources are used efficiently and farming practices are sustainable.

## 💡 Features

- Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and weather.
- Predictive crop yield model using historical weather and soil data.
- Task scheduling for continuous data collection.
- Scalable and customizable for different locations.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- FAO datasets
- Git & GitHub
- Task Scheduler (Windows)
- Jupyter Notebook / PyCharm

## 🌍 Location Focus

Wamba, Nigeria — chosen for its agricultural potential and relevance in local food systems.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `main.py` to start data processing or analysis.
3. Use the `weather.py` script for scheduled weather data collection.
4. Train or test ML models in `crop_yield_model.ipynb`.
